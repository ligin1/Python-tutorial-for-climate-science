# Python tutorial for climate science
This is the repository for Jupyter Books with tutorial material for data analysis methods for climate sciences. There are three jupyter notebooks:
### Tutorial_basics.ipynb
This tutorial includes codes to open a NetCDF file, select-slice data, group data, convert daily data to JJAS, plot time series, and plot spatial maps.
### Tutorial_IITBBS.ipynb
This tutorial includes codes to open a NetCDF file, compute and plot trends, detrend data, and perform linear regression. This notebook will be used for the training session at IIT BBS on 8th April.
### Tutorial_interactive.ipynb
This tutorial includes codes to create interactive plots or animation.

### Data used:
